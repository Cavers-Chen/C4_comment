# C_Minus

- Hello！！This is my compiling principles project, which began at 2021/11/23.

I managed to complete a virtual machine environment to run the assembly language, though the registers are limited.
The most of code refers to this blog.

Finally, I finished the whole code, but it doesn't work. There is one fatal reason is that I should run this program on Linux but Windows. By the way, there are tons of wrongs in the lotabout's code. But anyway, the blog did a good tutorial. So, I decided to review the c4, which is recommended by the writer who wrote the former blog. The link to c4 is below.
