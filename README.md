# C_Minus

- Hello！！This is my compiling principles project, which began at 2021/11/23.

I managed to complete a virtual machine environment to run the assembly language, though the registers are limited.
The most of code refers to this blog.

Finally, I finished the whole code, but it doesn't work. There is one fatal reason is that I should run this program on Linux but Windows. By the way, there are tons of wrongs in the lotabout's code. But anyway, the blog did a good tutorial. So, I decided to review the c4, which is recommended by the writer who wrote the former blog. The link to c4 is below.

It turns out that my code which was wtitten weeks ago is right, but it can't work on Windows, with the reason that some formulations of command-line are unavailable, but only works on Linux. So, I'll record my process to make this code., which will be published on this link soom.
